Python Notes:

General
    A computer program is a set of instructions that the computer understands
        To instruct a computer, you need to write in a language that the computer understands
    
Python:
    The python interpreter is a program that understands python code

    IDLE:
        The first window that pops up when you open IDLE is the interactive shell
            You can enter instructions in the >>>prompt 
            Python will perform them & return any results

    Interactive Shell:
        Operators
            The interactive shell can work like a calculator
            Each statement is a program instruction
            the (+) tells the computer to add the numbers around it
            The result is displayed in a new line
